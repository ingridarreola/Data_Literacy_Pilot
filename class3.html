						Visually Encoding Data <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text"-->

						notes: Examples of charts that use length or height include bar graphs. It's easier for our eyes to compare the length, and easy to spot what the patterns or trends are.

					<script type="text/template">
						<sup><sub> <span style="color:orange">Position or area</span> ➡️  less accurate estimate </sup></sub>

						<sup><sub> - Area is a form of visual encoding, common in maps </sup></sub> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						
						<sup><sub> - In the example below the size of the circle corresponds to population size, the text also calls out the bigger bubbles with big numbers </sup></sub> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

						<sup><sub> Source: Alberto Cairo, *How Charts Lie* </sup></sub>

						notes: This picture is an example of area encoding, which is used in maps. It's easy for our eyes to spot what the patterns or trends are, however if we compare one bubble to another it's really hard to tell which is bigger or by how much it differs.

				<section data-markdown id="visual-encoding-4" data-menu-title="Visual Encoding - Hue/Shade Example">
					<script type="text/template">
						<sup><sub>  Color is also used to encode data ➡️   the <span style="color:orange"> hue </span> = red/gray ➡️   color <span style="color:orange"> shade </span> = lighter/darker </sup></sub> 

						<sup><sub>  We can see high level trends, but it's harder to know their exact values </sup></sub>  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

						<sup><sub> Source: New York Times </sup></sub>

						notes: Color is another popular form of encoding data. The example here shows both shade, where lighter color indicates less threat, and a darker color indicates a darker threat. We also see how qualitative variables are represented with different colors. <br/> For example, here in Marion County, IN there are two colors: orange for heat stress and blue for rainfall. <br/> Our eyes can immediately see that different parts of the country are impacted by different threats.

						notes: In this activity 1. Pose an open-ended question which can solicit a variety of responses. <br/> 2.

						2. Try different graphic forms <br/>
						<br/>	
						- Charts vary with their encoding, depending on what they're trying to represent <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- If you want to enable more than one task, you may need to represent data in several ways <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- It's helpful to build different representations to see what works/what doesn't work <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

						<br/><br/>

						<sup><sub>Source: Alberto Cairo, *The Truthful Art*</sub></sup>
						
						notes: This is where the fun begins. Data exploration is an integral part of choosing the right form. Typically this means creating and constructing different views before arriving at the one that best fits your purpose.
