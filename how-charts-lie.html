						notes: Este gráfico muestra datos de un censo de sus partidos profesionales. Al principio de su carrera, ella tenía unos 15 años menos que sus competidores. Recientemente, ha llegado a ser hasta 22 años mayor. Rara vez Serena decía "no" a un desafío. ¿Quién es el mejor GOAT ("Greatest Of All Time") en el deporte en la actualidad: Tom Brady del fútbol o Serena Williams? Aunque el mariscal de campo Tom Brady tiene siete victorias en el Super Bowl, Serena tiene 23 títulos de campeona de Grand Slam de tenis. (Los torneos de Grand Slam son el Abierto de Australia, el Abierto de Francia, Wimbledon y el Abierto de Estados Unidos). Sus tiros característicos son su potente primer servicio, sus fulminantes golpes de derecha y sus voleas. Sus saques pasaban por encima de sus oponentes a una velocidad promedio de 106 millas por hora (128.6 millas por hora en un partido de 2013). Compare eso con la velocidad promedio de lanzamiento en el béisbol de 92.3 millas por hora. Investigue todos sus "primeros" — tanto dentro como fuera de la cancha. Su atletismo y poder son únicos.

						The chart scaffolding includes the content that provides context to the graph. It includes text, titles, subtitles, scales, legends, and the name of source.

						notes: It's possible for a chart to lie because it's poorly designed. In this example the visual distortion here makes it difficult to read a chart appropriately, which can lead this to be misinterpreted. Sometimes this is done intentionally, sometimes it is not intentional. In this example there isn't a scale and the 3D layout makes it very hard to compare which bars are taller and lower.

						notes: Charts can lie because of poor design, and in this example the chart distortion is the 3D layout of the various data points. There is a scale which is helpful, and illustrates how easy it can be to visually distort a chart. Compare the first data point and final data point. They are both relatively close to 35 million, however the visual distortion makes it appear like there's a bigger difference in value between them.

						notes: That curve, plotted linearly, is a skyrocketing curve. Plotted logarithmically, however, it transforms into a straight line — which means that deviations from the exponential spread of the virus become much easier to discern. Presented this way, the data for Italy clearly show that the infection rate is no longer exponential. The straight line is now a slight downward curve indicating that the rate of increase is slowing. <br/> - The chart on the right side shows the logarithmic scale and reveals how the while initially the the rate of spread appears to be the same, as time goes on the U.S. rate continues to increase while Italy's rate of spread stops trending upward and begin to bend

						Numbers can yield multiple interpretations and they can be approached from various angles -- this is why chart readers must remain vigilant because even the most honest chart creator makes mistakes 
	

						notes: Remember that when reading charts it's very important to verify *what* is being counted and *how* its being counted. Since numbers can be interpreted via different angles, the way it's represented can be approached in different ways. This is why it's up to us to be vigilant  Let's review the process of reading a chart 📊 ➡️ read it carefully, look at who published it, if you can visit the primary source then do. If there are doubts on the chart or story then don't share it and be wary of consuming information from that source.
