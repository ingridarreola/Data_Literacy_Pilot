						It's possible for a chart to lie because ➡️  it uses the wrong data
								
						- The first thing to look for is whether the author identifies sources ... if they don't then it's a red flag <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- Distrust any publication that doesn't clearly mention or link the source of the story that is published <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						- When reading charts it's very important to verify what is being counted and how its being counted <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						
	
						notes: It's possible for a chart to lie because it uses the wrong data. When you look at a chart take a moment to look for a source identified near the chart/graph. Next, review what is being counted and how it's being counted. The same numbers can convey two opposite messages, depending on how they are manipulated.

						When reading charts it's very important to verify *what* is being counted and *how* its being counted
								
						<sup><sub> - When the Coronavirus pandemic first began in early 2020 we saw many examples of 	the spread of the virus <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> </sup></sub>	
						<sup><sub> - The number of coronavirus cases is what was being counted and how it was counted differs whether you view the data in a linear scale versus a logarithmic scale <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> </sup></sub>	
						<sup><sub> - A linear scale plots out numbers linearly ➡️ 1,2,3,4, etc. A logarithmic scale plots out numbers where each number increases a certain number, for example 10, over the previous one ➡️ 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> </sup></sub>

						notes: That curve, plotted linearly, is a skyrocketing curve. Plotted logarithmically, however, it transforms into a straight line — which means that deviations from the exponential spread of the virus become much easier to discern. Presented this way, the data for Italy clearly show that the infection rate is no longer exponential. The straight line is now a slight downward curve indicating that the rate of increase is slowing. <br/> - The chart on the right side shows the logarithmic scale and reveals how the while initially the the rate of spread appears to be the same, as time goes on the U.S. rate continues to increase while Italy's rate of spread stops trending upward and begin to bend

						Numbers can yield multiple interpretations and they can be approached from various angles -- this is why chart readers must remain vigilant because even the most honest chart creator makes mistakes 
	

						notes: Remember that when reading charts it's very important to verify *what* is being counted and *how* its being counted. Since numbers can be interpreted via different angles, the way it's represented can be approached in different ways. This is why it's up to us to be vigilant  Let's review the process of reading a chart 📊 ➡️ read it carefully, look at who published it, if you can visit the primary source then do. If there are doubts on the chart or story then don't share it and be wary of consuming information from that source.
