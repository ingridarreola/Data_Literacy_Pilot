					### Data Literacy Activity

					- We will be working on data activities throughout the workshop. All the activities are analog and handouts are provided. 
					- [Observe, Collect, Draw! A Visual Journal](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/550de105e4b05c49fa2bba03/1531509621828-CIMNJB4AICDJOQNUFVN8/image-asset.png?format=1500w) by [Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec](https://giorgialupi.com/observe-collect-draw) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- This activity goes along with [Class 3](https://ingridarreola.github.io/Data_Literacy_Pilot/class3.html#/class-three/2), and centers on Visual Encoding.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->                    

					notes: Today we'll be working through several pages from the book [Observe, Collect, Draw! A Visual Journal](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/550de105e4b05c49fa2bba03/1531509621828-CIMNJB4AICDJOQNUFVN8/image-asset.png?format=1500w) by [Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec](https://giorgialupi.com/observe-collect-draw).

					Observe, Collect, Draw! How Does It Work?

					- <sup><sub> <span style="color:yellow"> **Learning to See**. </span> Data is everywhere, learning to view it as sets of information. </sup></sub> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- <sup><sub> <span style="color:yellow"> **Observing, Collecting, Drawing**. </span> The activities are guided so that you can observe, count, collect, and draw data. <span style="color:yellow"> **Crafting Your Visual Language**. </span> You'll learn to build your own vocabulary and use data as a design tool. </sup></sub> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    

					notes: Next students will be paired with Salesforce employees to work on activities from the Dear Data Book.

					<script type="text/template">
					#### What is a Visual Vocabulary?

					- As we observe, count, collect, and draw data we can start to see patterns and build a visual vocabulary. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- We can use color variation, symbols, thickness and length, and shape variation to build our visual vocabulary. These are examples of visual encoding. We will be praticing and learning more about this concept with the activities. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- Recall that visual encoding refers to how data is represented. We encode, or represent data with shapes and symbols. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					notes: Everything you see and like can become a part of your design material as you begin to observe, collect, draw data. Remember that visual encoding refers to content itself -- how data is represented. We typically encode, or represent data, with shapes and symbols.

				<section data-markdown id="data-activity-1" data-menu-title="Visual Encoding: Activity 1">
					<script type="text/template">
					#### Drawing Rules + Data: Visual Encoding Activity 1

					<sup><sub> - Drawing data requires setting up drawing rules that work well to represent any data, from a very small to a very large number. You will practice this concept with this activity. </sup></sub> 
                    <br/>
					<sup><sub> - There is a line from 1 - 6, where the value increases as we approach six. We are going to draw this increasing value by following the prompts. </sup></sub>  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    <br/>
                    <sup><sub> - Each line has instructions on how an increasing value is represented, follow the instructions and draw the value increasing. </sup></sub> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					notes: This is the first activity. Students have a worksheet with two pages. Students will draw and follow along with the prompt provided on the worksheet. They'll see examples of visual encoding such as line weight, area, hue and shade, angle.

				<section data-markdown id="data-activity-1-q" data-menu-title="Visual Encoding Activity 1 Q/A">
					<script type="text/template">
					#### Drawing Rules + Data: Activity 1 Q/A

					- Discuss in your groups: (1) What are some examples of visual encoding that you saw in the activity? (2) What are some drawing rules that work well to represent data effectively? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- (3) What challenges did you encounter while drawing the increasing value according to the prompts? (4) How might you adjust the drawing rules if you were representing a larger range of values? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    

					notes: Take some time and discuss among your classmates the following questions. You don't have to discuss all the questions, choose the ones that look most interesting and talk between the time allotted.

				<section data-markdown id="data-activity-2" data-menu-title="Visual Encoding: Activity 2">
					<script type="text/template">
					#### Rectangle Variations: Visual Encoding Activity 2

					<sup><sub> - You will draw as a way of building your own visual vocablary. The worksheet has outline of shapes: rectangles, squares, circle, and triangles.</sup></sub> 
                    <br/>
                    <sup><sub> - Direction: take a shape and add some variation to it. Think about how it can vary with color, patterns, splitting color inside the shape, overlapping shapes or symbols. </sup></sub> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->                    
                    <br/>
                    <sup><sub> - Experiment with different combinations and draw as many variations on the shapes as you can. </sup></sub> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->                    

					notes: This is the second activity. Students have a worksheet with the left side providing examples of variations and the right side is an empty page for them to complete the exercise. This is all about practicing ways to demonstrate visual encoding. For example, hue and shade, angle/area, line weight, etc. The idea is to get students started on seeing examples of encoding.

					- (3) What are some ways you can vary the appearance of the shapes provided on the worksheet? (4) Reflect on the effectiveness of different variations in conveying information or creating visual interest. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					#### Color Palette Testing: Visual Encoding Activity 3

					- You will draw as a way of building your own visual vocablary. This activity focuses on visual encoding with hue, shade, and color. Read through the descriptions provided that explain what categorical, sequential, and diverging color palettes are. 
					- Practice creating color palettes for: categorical, sequential, and diverging. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					
					notes: This is the third activity. Students have a worksheet with the left side focusing on categorical color palettes and the right side focusing on sequential color palettes and diverging color palettes. This is all about practicing ways to demonstrate visual encoding with hue, shade, and color. Students will color and test these types of palettes.

					- (3) We've talked about quantitative and qualitative variables. Which of the color palettes would be used for quantitative variables? (4) Which of the color palettes would be used for qualitative variables? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
