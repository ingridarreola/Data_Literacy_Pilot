                        1. Think about what task you want to enable
                        2. Try different graphic forms
                        3. Arrange the components of the graphic so its easy to get meaning from it
                        4. Test the outcomes yourself and with the intended audience

						**Chart Scaffolding**
						<br/>
						The chart scaffolding includes the content that provides context to the graph. It includes text, titles, subtitles, scales, legends, and the name of source.

						To read a chart well, you must focus on the features that surround the content and support it* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
						
						<sup><sub>*Source: Alberto Cairo, *How Charts Lie*</sub></sup>

						notes: Next let's take a look at the content of the graph, the visual encoding. One form of encoding stands out: color. The color shade, darker or lighter, corresponds to whether either party flipped the seat. The 2nd method of encoding: position. The position on the vertical axis is proportional to the difference in percentage points in comparison to the results of the 2016 presidential election. i.e. the higher up, the better Democrats did in comparison to 2016, the lower down in the chart, the worse they did.
