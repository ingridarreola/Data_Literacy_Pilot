					### Data Literacy Activity

					- We will be working on data activities throughout the workshop. All the activities are analog and handouts are provided. 
					- This activity goes along with Class 2, and is an *Introduction to Data & Visual Vocabulary*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- [Observe, Collect, Draw! A Visual Journal](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/550de105e4b05c49fa2bba03/1531509621828-CIMNJB4AICDJOQNUFVN8/image-asset.png?format=1500w)¬†by¬†[Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec](https://giorgialupi.com/observe-collect-draw) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    
					notes: Today we'll be working through several pages from the book [Observe, Collect, Draw! A Visual Journal](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/550de105e4b05c49fa2bba03/1531509621828-CIMNJB4AICDJOQNUFVN8/image-asset.png?format=1500w)¬†by¬†[Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec](https://giorgialupi.com/observe-collect-draw).

					#### What is Data?

					- Data is information. It is everywhere because if it can *be mapped, counted, or measured it is data.* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- All of the activities and worksheets that we'll work on will help us see how data exists everywhere around us, and we will practice observing, collect, and drawing the patterns revealed. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    

					notes: Data is information. It is everywhere because if it can *be mapped, counted, or measured* it is data. As you start to practice observing, collecting, and drawing you'll see patterns emerge around you.

				</section>
                <section data-markdown id="visual-vocabulary" data-menu-title="Visual Vocabulary">
					<script type="text/template">
					#### What is a Visual Vocabulary?

					- As we observe, count, collect, and draw data we can start to see patterns and build a visual vocabulary. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- We can use color variation, symbols, thickness and length, and shape variation to build our visual vocabulary. Each of the activities help us develop a visual vocabulary. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    

					notes: Everything you see and like can become a part of your design material as you begin to observe, collect, draw data.

				<section data-markdown id="observe-collect-draw-3" data-menu-title="Drawing as Measuring Activity">
					<script type="text/template">
					#### Drawing as Measuring Activity

					- You will draw as a way of measuring and capturing time. We'll set a timer and you will draw small circles on the worksheet provided. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- Draw small circles for (1) 10 seconds (2) 45 seconds (3) 1 minute 30 seconds and (4) 2 minutes 15 seconds. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    

					notes: This is the first activity. Students have a worksheet with four boxes. They'll draw circles for the determined time on each box. Teacher sets timer correpsonding to 10 seconds, 45 seconds, 1 minute 30 seconds, 2 minutes 15 seconds.

					<sup><sub> - You will draw as a way of measuring and capturing time. A timer will be set for 2 minutes and you will follow the prompt on the worksheet provided. </sup></sub> 
                    <br/>
                    <sup><sub> - Prompt 1: for every full inhale and exhale of breath, draw a circle. </sup></sub> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					notes: This is the second activity. Students have a worksheet with two boxes. They'll draw circles for each breath that they take for 3 minutes. Teacher sets timer for 2 minutes. In the next box they'll draw a shape each time they blink their eyes.

					#### Drawing as Measuring Activity Q/A

					- Discuss in your groups: (1) what did you notice in the activities? (2) what patterns did you see? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- (3) What did you notice about your drawings as the time intervals increased? (4) Were you surprised by the frequency of your breaths and blinks during the activity? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    

					notes: You don't have to discuss all the questions, choose the ones that look most interesting and talk between the time allotted.

					<script type="text/template">
					#### Following the Rules

					- Data ‚û°Ô∏è Rules ‚û°Ô∏è Data Visualization <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- Data follows our rules to draw out a specific design. These rules are used to encode data. The last two activities are an example of how to follow rules using your own personal data. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    

					notes: If we break down the activities so far then we can summarize it with the following. Data needs to be fed through rules that we design as data designers and that comes out as a data visualization. The data set makes the rules for us, the data itself informs the form. Structure determines function. The way that structure data will inform it's function.

					#### Following the Rules (Using Your Data)

					- Drawing 1: How old are you? For every year, draw a ‚ö™
					- Drawing 2: How are you feeling? Draw a üåª where its size is equivalent to how you feel. Smaller = a little & Larger = A lot. If you are sad draw this in blue. If you are happy, draw in red. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- Drawing 3: How many family members live with you / live elsewhere? Draw family that lives with you inside the circle, and those who live elsewhere outside. Draw a üî∫ for people older & a ‚ö™ for people younger.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					
					notes: These are the first questions to ask the employee panel, starting out with general questions and one student question.

					#### Following the Rules Activity Q/A

					- Discuss in your groups: (1) How did your classmates interpret your data visualization, and did it align with your intended message?  (2) How were the design of your drawings influenced by the rules you established? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- (3) Did the act of data activity cause any self-reflection or new awareness? (4) Discuss any challenges or surprises in communicating your data through visual representation. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    

					notes: Take some time and discuss among your classmates the following questions. You don't have to discuss all the questions, choose the ones that look most interesting and talk between the time allotted.
