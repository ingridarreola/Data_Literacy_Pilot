					#### Why Is Data Literacy Important?

					<sup><sub> - We are living through the "4th Industrial Revolution" -- a digital world that creates massive amounts of information </sup></sub> <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <br/>
					<sup><sub> - Data has to go through people, or get refined, to get value. Data literacy allows us to get value from all that information </sup></sub> <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					notes: We are living through the 4th industrial revolution. <br/> It's hard to find example of someone who doesn't have a computer in their pocket ... i.e. a smartphone. It's hard to navigate in the world without a computer or access to a digital world. <br/> Technology keeps advancing, each new product connects us more and produces more data (i.e. smart watch, smart things) <br/> Data literacy helps us understand our own data, understand how to read and understand information, which will only continue to grow

					#### What is Data?

					- Data is information. It is everywhere because if it can *be mapped, counted, or measured it is data.* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- As we observe, count, collect, and draw data we can start to see patterns and build a visual vocabulary. We can use color variation, symbols, thickness and length, and shape variation to build the vocabulary. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					notes: If we break down the activities so far then we can summarize it with the following.

Structure determines function. The way that structure data will inform it's function.

					- (3) Did the act of data activity cause any self-reflection or new awareness? (4) Discuss any challenges or surprises in communicating your data through visual representation. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
